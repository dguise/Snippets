# Snippets

## What's this?

This is a repository of good-to-have code solutions for Unity game development.
Snippets should be code that is frequently used, very generic or otherwise really good to have in the future. 

The Snippets should, preferably, be... 

- [ ] As generic as possible
- [ ] Working/building without unincluded dependencies
	Unless dependecies are commonly used/exist in this repository. Should be explained in readme.md
- [ ] Include a readme.md on how to use it
	Unless it's obvious

## How do I add a Snippet

1. Clone this repository
`git clone https://github.com/dguise/Snippts.git`

2. Add a folder with a descreptive name to the root
`/CoolThing/`

3. Add your necessary files/subfolders to your directory
`/CoolThing/DoCoolThing.cs`
`/CoolThing/readme.md`

4. Commit & push
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "Add CoolThing"`
- `git push`
